	Description
	You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i]
	seconds.

	Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds
	is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j
	with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

	Example 1:
	Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
	(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
	(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
	(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

	Example 2:
	Input: time = [60,60,60]
	Output: 3
	Explanaion: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.

	Constraints:
	1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
	1 <= time[i] <= 500

            map.put(data % 60, map.getOrDefault(data % 60, 0) + 1); // [30,20,150,100,40] using this example 150
            // 150 % 60 gives 30 and as we have already encountered 1 of the 30 previously. SO, we will update our count from 0 to 1
